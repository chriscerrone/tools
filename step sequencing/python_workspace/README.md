# Generating a sample-steps.txt file

It is pretty straight forward for Chris to make a google sheet of cue numbers, measure numbers, timestamps, (MM:SS.SSS) and instructions for what files to play when. This script takes in a CSV file (which can be downloaded from google docs) and outputs a sample-steps.txt file with timestamps in totalMilis, and reset-seek data baked in.

TODO: explain, examples, how to use, what has to be done even after you run the script, etc.

# piece launcher patch

this patch is a generic launcher that opens up the actual piece which is kept in a sub folder.
this keeps the project folder clean and easy to use, while also allowing us to keep all the samples in a sub folder.
the patch named "disabled launcher" has a patch cord disabled so that the contents can be viewed without it closing itself, which is what the normal launcher does

## using the launcher
- grab the patch named "\_NAME\_OF\_PIECE\_LAUNCER" and rename the "NAME\_OF\_PIECE" part with whatever the piece name is, e.g. "\_BEAUFORT\_SCALES\_LAUNCHER"
- in a subfolder titled "lib", name your actual main piece with the same name, except with the "LAUNCHER" part replaced with "MAIN", e.g. "\_BEAUFORT\_SCALES\_MAIN"
